# Lab-session-4
*All my documentation is in the jupyter notebook (Lab_Session_4(4)) itself in the starting and then follows the code for data scrapping and cleaning.

I have made the MVP for the lab session 4 which includes some intermediate versions of my visualizations and the improvements that I can do on them. Everything is in the jupyter notebook that I have uploaded.
